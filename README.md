# Rivendell Web Broadcast
Web system for manage Rivendell Radio Automation created by Andreas Olsson to help manage rivendell remote with the most function.

## The project
This project started after i fixed some bugs in an old script by Brian McGlynn for to use with Rivendell Radio Automation. The original script can be found here: https://github.com/bpm1992/rivendell/tree/rdweb/web/rdphp

But i needed something with more user friendly layout with more function. So i started to work on this.

## How to use
To use this you need a machine that have Rivendell installed. This system can not work without it. It uses the user created in RDAdmin. Run it behind a reverse proxy with https support. This is develop for **Version 4** of Rivendell and has not tested with older versions.
