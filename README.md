Web system for manage Rivendell Radio Automation created by Andreas Olsson to help manage rivendell remote with the most function.

The goal with this is to be able to do the most things from this system.

**This is still in development so there can be things that not works, contain bugs and things can be changed. You use it at your own risk. Do not use it on a live rivendell machine unless you know what you are doing, and that you know it will not brake your system. Before you do anything. Read the [**Documentation**](https://olsson82.github.io/rivwebdoc/)**

**Please be advice that this system use BOTH Rivendells API and also do direct changes in the database**

## Multitrack Editor
There is an multitrack editor in voicetracking for testing. Not recommended to use it on live production server yet. This need to be activated in system settings. Read documents for more info.

## The project
This project started after i fixed some bugs in an old script by Brian McGlynn for to use with Rivendell Radio Automation. The original script can be found here: https://github.com/bpm1992/rivendell/tree/rdweb/web/rdphp

But i needed something with more user friendly layout with more function. So i started to work on this. Im not an professional programmer, so you know.

## How to use
To use this you need a machine that have Rivendell installed. This system can not work without it. It uses the user created in RDAdmin. Run it behind a reverse proxy with https support. This is develop for **Version 4** of Rivendell and has not tested with older versions.

The system has a installer, and no files need to be modified. Read the installation section in the documentation.
